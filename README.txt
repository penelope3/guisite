Ran the site through both html and css validators, and unfortunately it seems like the css won't
pass due to the bootstrap file containing errors(this was linked directly from the bootstrap site)

Compared to hw 2, this version has substantially less css styling due to bootstrap use. I have redone all
the section/div tags to hold new cards, where before they were centered text boxes. I used bootstrap to do 
much of the styling right from the html file, such as using mb/mt for margin-top/bottom and using img class
to align my images properly. I've also utilized shadow-sm for some fun dimension to the cards.

Much of my new knowledge for this has come from doing research on nav bars and utilizing w3schools for
ways to improve and minimize css styling.
